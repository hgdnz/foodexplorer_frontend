## üöÄ How it works

This project is divided into two parts:
1. Backend (food-explorer-backend folder) 
2. Frontend (food-explorer-frontend folder)

üí° The Frontend needs the Backend to be running to work.

### Pre-requisites
Before you begin, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine:
- [Git] (https://git-scm.com)
- [Node.js] (https://nodejs.org/en/)
- In addition, it is good to have an editor to work with the code like [VSCode] (https://code.visualstudio.com/)

#### üé≤ Running the Server (Backend)

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone git@github.com:hgdnz/foodexplorer_frontend.git

# Access the project folder in your terminal
$ cd foodexplorer_backend

# Install the dependencies
$ npm install

# run the migration and seed
$ npm migrate
$ npm seed

# Run the application in development mode
$ npm run dev

# Admin login
$ email: admin@mail.com
$ password: 123456

# User login
$ email: user@mail.com
$ password: 123456

# The Server will start at port: 3333 - go to http://localhost:3333
# Check the terminal status for confirm the port
```

# Access the project folder in your terminal
$ cd foodexplorer_frontend

# Install the dependencies
$ npm install

# Run the application in development mode
$ npm run dev

# The application will open on the port: 5173 - go to http://http://localhost:5173/
